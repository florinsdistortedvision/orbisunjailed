## For who is this method?

 * This method allows direct access to the previous DNS method via the Internet Browser and self-hosting.

### DNS Hijacking Fix Guide

 * For some people, their ISP (Internet Provider) will not allow the user to use any DNS thus can't jailbreak the same way as everyone else.
 * Don't worry, it is just as easy to continue the guide.
 * On your PS4, open Internet Browser and navigate to either:
    * https://cthugha.exploit.menu/ - Direct link to the DNS site.
    * https://kar0218.github.io/ - Another all in one host by Karo.
 * Simply pick one of these, pick your firmware and select GoldHEN. 
 * **FOR 9.00 ONLY: If you see "Insert USB now", plug in your USB drive we did with Rufus, wait until the notification pops and disappears, then press OK.** If you see "You're all set", it means you now jailbroken the PS4 (also on FW lower than 9.00 this should appear without a USB drive)
 * Additionally, to also block PSN connection like the DNS would've done, you can navigate on your PS4, after jailbreaking, to **Debug settings > PlayStation Network > NP Environment**, and simply change **np** value to any other word (*like block, for example*).
 * Congratulations, you now have jailbroken your PS4! Enjoy! **(9.00 users, you need to remove the USB after you see the "You're all set!" screen).**
 * Done.

## Congrats, you have now jailbroken your PS4!
