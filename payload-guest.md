## What is Payload Guest and why do I need it?
 
 * Payload Guest is a homebrew application designed to load payloads without the need of always opening the browser and navigating to a host.
 * **This will not remove the complete need of hosts. You still need to jailbreak with GoldHEN before hand**.
 * The main reason for this is that the success rate for re-exploiting will be lower than just running the code "natively". For everything but GoldHEN you should use this app as the main payload loader.

## Enough talk, let's start...

 * Payload Guest can be found via [Homebrew Browser](hb-store.md).
 * Jailbreak the PS4 using GoldHEN.
 * **Navigate to Settings > GoldHEN > Check Enable BinLoader Server.**
 * In order for the payloads to be seen in Payload Guest, you can either:
    * Copy the payloads to **/data/payloads/** if you want them in PS4's internal HDD - can be sent via FTP.
    * Copy the payloads to a **payloads** folder on the root of a USB drive. Must be formatted as FAT32 or exFAT.
 * Payloads can be found here: [payloads](/backupfiles/payloads.zip).
    * Extract the archive and copy all payloads that match your firmware to payloads folder. **No other folders!**
