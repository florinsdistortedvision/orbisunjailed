## What is offline activated account and what can I do with it?

* Activated accounts unlock some locked functionality such as Save Data Management (USB only).
* It's also good to have one, if you wish to send a save to a latest firmware PS4 or PS5, **only if your account ID is the same**.
* **Note!: This will NOT mess with your PSN account. It WON'T allow online play, or actual sign-in to PSN servers. You WON'T get banned if you use your account ID. It's a fake unlock mostly!**
* This guide will show you how to activate a account, including how to use your PSN account ID.
* **Also do this only once! If you want to change it a second time, DO MAKE A BACKUP of your saves using [Apollo Save Tool](apollo-save-tool.md) !**

## Getting your PSN Account ID

* **You are not required to use your own one, but it's good to do so if you decide to send saves via Save Data Management (the official way) to latest firmware/unexplotable PS4s and to PS5s.**
* If you do not wish to do so, look down for the other method.
* On your PC, navigate to : https://store.playstation.com/
* Log out of your account if you have logged in previously.
* Select Sign in button it top right corner of the site.
* At the page of sign in, if on a Chromium browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,etc) press Ctrl+Shift+I.
* Select Network tab. Select All in Network tab.
* Input your email and password on sign-in page and log in.
* Back on the network tab, in search bar search for: "getPro".
* Two files should appear, click on one of them to see which one has your account ID (among other info), should be the second one.
* Account ID should appear, note that down.
* Convert the account ID from Decimal to Hexadecimal using this site: <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html"> Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter </a>.
* Copy the result (Hex signed 2'nd complement). That is the final account ID you need.

### Activating your account

* On your PS4, open Internet Browser and navigate to https://kar0218.github.io/900N/index.html
* Select Web Activator. Wait for the site to load.
* A list of users should now populate. On your user input the account ID you noted earlier.
* Select Activate.
* Done.

## Activating a account with a random account ID

* **This is the method for a random ID only if you don't care about your saves being sent to your PSN PS5 or latest firmware PS4.**
* On your PS4, open Internet Browser and navigate to https://kar0218.github.io/900N/index.html
* Select Web Activator. Wait for the site to load.
* A list of users should now populate. Just click on the user you want to activate, it should now input a random ID.
* Select Activate.
* Done.
