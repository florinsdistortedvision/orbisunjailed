## Before getting too happy, please note!

Jailbreaking on the PS4 will never happen on the latest firmware! A quick reason is to avoid perhaps millions of console and account bans, online cheaters and everything else that can ruin other people&#39;s fun (which is a lesson learned from the PS3). Below you can find quick info on what firmware should I be on before attempting anything (this will get updated as soon as Sony releases a new firmware and when hackers release a new jailbreak for newer firmwares):

<pre>
<strong>Latest firmware (unexploited / cannot be jailbroken): 10.50.</strong>
<strong>Latest exploited firmware (can be jailbroken): 9.00 (and everything lower).</strong>
</pre>

<ul>
	<li>I'm on the latest firmware, can I still jailbreak? -<strong> No!</strong> Unfortunately, you are stuck on that firmware and cannot downgrade/go back to a previous one. You have 2 options: <strong>either wait on the firmware you're on and DON'T update your console, or simply buy another one.</strong></li>
	<li>Will I get banned from PSN? No! By jailbreaking you are already on a lower firmware than the latest thus you can't do anything online without updating (this was made by design by Sony), which removes every worry from your account (you will never use it again on a jailbroken PS4).</li>
</ul>

## Enough talk, let's start...

Congrats, you&#39;re one of the lucky ones. To begin, you have 3 options to jailbreak:

  * [1. Start fresh](fresh-start-jailbreak.md). This means deleting everything from your HDD and update/reset your PS4 to the factory settings.
  * [2. Jailbreak without resetting](no-reset-jailbreak.md). This means updating to a exploitable firmware and jailbreaking without resseting/erasing the HDD.
  * [3. Alternative method of jailbreak](alternative-jailbreak.md). For people who cannot use DNS because of their ISP and for those who want to self-host.
