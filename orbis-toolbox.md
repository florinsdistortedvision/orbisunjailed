## What is Orbis Toolbox and what can I do with it?

* Orbis Toolbox is a suite of UI tweaks and features that provides easy access of multiple shorcuts, FPS and usage overlay, various DevKit/TestKit features such as Title ID labels, etc.
* **Note!: This will not work if you already used ReSys Flasher. Also, it will not stay persistent after reboot, as it is a payload!**

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Jailbreak your PS4 using GoldHEN.
* As it is a payload, there are multiple ways to send it to your PS4, such as:
  * Send <a href="https://github.com/OSM-Made/Orbis-Toolbox/releases"> the payload </a> to /data/payloads/ via FTP or PS4Xplorer either on internal HDD or any external USB drive formatted as exFAT. Open [Payload Guest](payload-guest.md) and load the payload.
  * Alternatively, navigate to your favourite exploit host and enable it there.
* After you load it, navigate to Settings.
* A new entry should appear called Orbis Toolbox.
* Navigate to it, enable and disable your favourite settings.
* Done.
