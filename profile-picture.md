## What are custom profile pictures?

* Profile picture is the profile icon found in the various parts of the OS, such as homescreen (function area), quick menu, log-in screen, etc.
* This guide will show you how you can easily make any picture as the profile avatar.

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Download and install:
     * <a href="https://mega.nz/file/zs5GUCjT#BGEh3sAYpyFwxFM6dXVYS2j1jTwlcb2y70XenWOl2oU"> PS4 Avatar Maker by Lappy </a>
     * <a href="https://pkg-zone.com/details/LAPY20001"> PS4 Xplorer by Lappy </a>
     * <a href="https://directx-9-0c.en.lo4d.com/windows"> DirectX 9.0 needed for PS4 Avatar Maker </a>
* After installing everything, including DirectX 9.0, prepare your image (format doesn't matter).
* Make sure your image is a perfect square format, to ensure no part of the image will be cropped or stretched (use any type of image editor if needed).
* Open PS4 Avatar Maker, select the type of account (Local or Activated).
* Double click the middle part and select your image.
* Select Export Avatar, and select a name and location.
* Put the exported avatar on a USB Drive or FTP to a location on the internal HDD of the PS4.
* On the PS4, jailbreak using GoldHEN.
* Open PS4Xplorer, navigate the location of the avatar you set.
* Select it and press X to apply (you might need to do it 2 times).
* To see it, log out and log back in your account (you don't need to reboot).
* Done.
