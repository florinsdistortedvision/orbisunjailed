## What is a backport and do I need it?

* As you might've noticed, there are plenty of firmwares exploited in order to jailbreak. Lower firmwares, even though they are usually notorious for great stability and success rates, are technically released before newer games. Ex: 5.05 firmware was released back in 2018 while a game like Persona 5 Strikers was released in 2020.
* Sony implemented a check to force the user to update to the latest firmware in order to play newer games (both on digital versions of games and disc games). 
* Clever hackers found a way to disable that check so that no matter what firmware version you have and how old it might be, the game/app could be launched. That kind of patch is called a backport patch.
* Do I need a backport patch? Yes and no. It depends on your firmware. If you are on latest exploitable FW you don't need a backport until a jailbreak for a new firmware will be released (and you decide to stay on your current firmware).
* If you are on a lower firmware you will need a backport patch in order to launch a newer game. Here you can find out what game requries which firmware:

## Enough talk, let's start...

Congrats, you&#39;re one of the lucky ones. To begin, you have 2 options to jailbreak:

[1. Start fresh](fresh-start-jailbreak.md). This means deleting everything from your HDD and update/reset your PS4 to the factory settings.<strong> This is the recommended path because it ensures you will have no additional trouble (could happen).</strong>

[2. Jailbreak without resetting](no-reset-jailbreak.md). For those who really want to.<strong>Not recommended!</strong>
