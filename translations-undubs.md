## What are undubs and fan translations?

* Fan translation is a fan-made project that translates a game's native language (usually either fixes a broken localisation or translates a game that never has been translated).
* Undub is a asset swap that's meant to keep the original voice actor's language but have English text.

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Unfortunately, this part of PS4 scene seems to be super small/underrated. As soon as more translations are released I'll update this list.
* Fan-translated games:
