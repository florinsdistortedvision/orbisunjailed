## What is the Homebrew Store?

* Homebrew Store is a store that allows the user to download a collection of useful homebrew apps (PS4Xplorer, etc), media apps (Youtube, Media Player, etc), fan-made games & utilities.
* Homebrew Store can also be a game manager allowing installation/uninstallation of updates, games, dumper to disk and more.


## Enough talk, let's start...

    * <a href="https://pkg-zone.com/Store-R2.pkg"> PS4 Homebrew Store R2 </a>:
* Copy the pkg to the root of a USB drive.
* Navigate to the PS4 > Settings > GoldHEN > Package Installer and install the pkg.
* Done.
   * To install a app, you need to first download it, wait until it's finished, then select install.
