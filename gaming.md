## About gaming on a jailbroken PS4

* What games can I play? You can find the majority of games released released during 2021 and before. If you want to know how many, *there are about 2856 games already available to play*.
* What games can't I play? Mostly games that are online only or the majority of the game needs to be online-only such as Fornite, Apex Legends etc. Note that online play on a jailbroken PS4 is possibile but there are a few games compatibile. A guide can be found
[here.](onlineplay.md)
* How do games become available? The process is called dumping. This means, inserting a PS4 game disc and running a dumper payload to decrypt and put the whole game on external HDD. After the slow process is done, it is then transferred to the PC where a FAKE pkg is made, removing the need of the disc.
* So to keep it short, most games playable come from disc media.


## Games

* No piracy links will be here!
* Games on the PS4 are huge, thus you might find games in many parts (archives). You need the following tools:
    * <a href="https://jdownloader.org/download/index"> JDownloader is a multi-part downloader</a>
    * <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0"> WinRAR is a popular unarchiver</a>
* After unarchiving, you should have your game in a .pkg file. **PKG is the format everything installable will be on the PS4**
* To install them on your PS4, format a USB drive as exFAT or FAT32 (**FAT32 is not recommended because of the 4GB file limit**). Put the .pkg on the root of the drive.
* Navigate on your PS4 to Setttings > GoldHEN > Package Installer. Select the pkg and wait. Your game will now appear on the homescreen.

## Updates & DLC

* Updates & DLC need to be linked to the same game version and region. If not, they will not install.
* To check a game region and version download:
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/ps4pkgviewer">PS4PKGViewer - leecherman (google.com)</a>&nbsp;- PS4PKGViewer</p>
* Take your game .pkg and open it via PS4PKGViewer. Take note of:

* PKG type: **FAKE** is a homebrew pkg not official that will not require license/disc. **REAL/RETAIL** is a direct pkg created and verified by Sony **(these cannot be played unless you have the disc or license)**.
* **Fake and Retail cannot be combined.**
* **A RETAIL pkg cannot be converted to FAKE. A FAKE pkg cannot be converted to RETAIL.**
* CONTENT ID: Note the CUSA number. This is your region and version of the game. **If your updates/dlc and game content ID do not match, they will not install.**
