	<li>After unarchiving, you should have your game in a .pkg file.<strong> PKG is the format everything installable will be on the PS4</strong>.</li>
	<li>To install them on your PS4, format a USB drive as exFAT or FAT32 (<strong>FAT32 is not recommended because of the 4GB file limit</strong>). Put the .pkg on the root of the drive.</li>
	<li>Navigate on your PS4 to Setttings > GoldHEN > Package Installer. Select the pkg and wait. Your game will now appear on the homescreen.</li>

PKG type: <strong>FAKE</strong> is a homebrew pkg not official that will not require license/disc. <strong>REAL/RETAIL</strong> is a direct pkg created and verified by Sony <strong>(these cannot be played unless you have the disc or license).</strong>Fake and Retail cannot be combined.
CONTENT ID: Note the CUSA number. This is your region and version of the game. If your updates/dlc and game content ID do not match, they will not install.
