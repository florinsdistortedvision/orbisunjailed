## What is Orbis Retail Patcher?

* ORBIS Patches is an actively maintained archive of PlayStation 4 game updates. With over 40.000 patches in the database ORBIS Patches is the biggest patch database to date.
* **ORBIS Patches will only work with retail pkg and NOT fake pkg. Basically disc only games.**
* PS4 Patch Installer is a homebrew app based on ORBIS Patches that removes any PC work needed to search & copy the updates to the PS4.

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Download PS4 Patch Installer:
    * <a href="https://orbispatches.com/homebrew/download"> Patch Installer </a>
* Copy the pkg to the root of a USB drive.
* Navigate to the PS4 > Settings > GoldHEN > Package Installer and install the pkg.
* Done.
   * Your games will appear on the list, select them and install latest one in **green**.
   * Red patches cannot be applied since they require higher FW than exploited.

## Note

 * PS4 Patch Installer can also be found to download via
[Homebrew Store](hb-store.md)
