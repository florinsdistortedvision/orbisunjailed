## What are some other homebrew I can use?

* All can be downloaded and installed via the
[Homebrew Store](hb-store.md)
* There are loads of homebrew you might need/try on the PS4. Here are some recommandations:
    * PS4Xplorer - file manager + FTP client
    * Remote Package Installer - pkg receiver that turns your PC into your personal PSN Store server.
    * Internal Package Installer - a install app that will allow the removal of USB drives, allowing you to install pkg from the same HDD.
    * [Payload Guest](payload-guest.md) - a app that loads payloads without the need of a internet browser host (**does need jailbreak to be already loaded via GoldHEN**).
    * Apollo Save Tool - automatic save-mounting, offline account activation & more.
    * [RetroArch](emulators.md) - a multi-emulator frontend that allows running a variety of systems on PS4.
    * PS4Player - a simple MP4 player with .srt subtitle support.
    * And many more.
