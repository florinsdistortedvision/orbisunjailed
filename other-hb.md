## What are some other homebrew I can use?

* All can be downloaded and installed via the [Homebrew Store](hb-store.md)
* There are loads of homebrew you might need/try on the PS4. Here are some recommandations:

### Homebrew

* Homebrew applications & tweaks:
    * PS4Xplorer - file manager + FTP client
    * [Remote Package Installer](remote-package-installer.md) - pkg receiver that turns your PC into your personal PSN Store server.
    * Internal Package Installer - a install app that will allow the removal of USB drives, allowing you to install pkg from the same HDD.
    * [Payload Guest](payload-guest.md) - a app that loads payloads without the need of a internet browser host (**does need jailbreak to be already loaded via GoldHEN**).
    * [Apollo Save Tool](apollo-save-tool.md) - automatic save-mounting, offline account activation & more.
    * [RetroArch](emulators.md) - a multi-emulator frontend that allows running a variety of systems on PS4.
    * PS4 Temperature - APU temperature monitoring
    * Icon Mask - change the shape of icons
    * PS4 PluginX - a multi-tool app for background music, icons
    * ReSys Hybrid Installer - a tool designed to restore some functionality from a DevKit/TestKit such as permanent debug settings. **Note! This will NOT replace the need to jailbreak or the need of GoldHEN. This is only useful if you only run retail pkg for your disc!**
    * ppPlay - multi codec player
    * PS4Player - a simple MP4 player with .srt subtitle support.
