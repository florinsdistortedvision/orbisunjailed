## Why do I need to change the guide?

* Some people have WV-XXXX errors when trying DNS method while jailbreaking. The reason is their ISP (Internet Service Provider - the company you pay your internet from) is blocking any user DNS for "security measures". This procedure is called in the PS4 jailbreak scene : "DNS Hijacking".
* If this is your case, don't worry, it is just a simple to go around that, by visiting:
    * [DNS Hijacking Fix](alternative-dnsfix.md)


## Additionally...

* Some people might want to self-host their exploit host. Self-hosting means running a exploit host (such as Karo's website, Al Azif's website) locally (tethered to their PC).
* **Note that if you have DNS Hijacking problem, you can NOT do this method!**
* If this is your case, visit:
