## Why and what exactly is Orbis?

Orbis is PS4's code name used internally by Sony when it was in development. Orbis is also the name of the native operating system of the PlayStation 4, a fork of FreeBSD version 9.0, released on January 12, 2012.


## What does jailbreaking your PS4 mean?

Jailbreaking is, on a basic level, a term used when the console gets exploited to unlock various levels of the firmware that allows the access to many features previously accessible on a DevKit/TestKit (used by game developers and testers) to a consumer.

## What can I do with a jailbroken PS4?

After a successful jailbreak, you can unlock and try the following:

<ul>
	<li>Install and play your game backups/disc games without needing a disc/license/PSN account.</li>
	<li>Access media apps such as YouTube, Netflix without the need of a PSN account.</li>
	<li>Access various homebrew and other fan-made tweaks to your favorite games such as useful applications, fan translations, undubs, emulators, 60FPS patches, etc.</li>
	<li>Make and install custom UI tweaks such as custom dynamic or static themes, removing and hiding useless apps from the homescreen, changing system sounds, etc.</li>
	<li>Access and install a fully featured OS like Linux to completely turn your PS4 into a PC.</li>
</ul>

## What can't I do with a jailbroken PS4?

While the advantages are plenty, you will lose some functionality such as:

<ul>
	<li>Online play on <strong>most</strong> games. This is the biggest factor of jailbreaking that many can live without. I used the term most because you can play online on some games by using custom servers, but that is more a bonus than something you should expect.</li>
	<li>All PSN features such as messaging, online trophy syncing, various PS Plus features such as online save data upload and other features that are dependent on PSN such as Spotify.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Depending on the release date of the jailbreak, firmware and games, some newer games will not be available. As soon as new jailbreak will appear, those new games will also appear.</li>
</ul>
