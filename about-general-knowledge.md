## Why and what exactly is Orbis?

Orbis is PS4's code name used internally by Sony when it was in development. Orbis is also the name of the native operating system of the PlayStation 4, a fork of FreeBSD version 9.0, released on January 12, 2012.


## What does jailbreaking your PS4 mean?

Jailbreaking is, on a basic level, a term used when the console gets exploited to unlock various levels of the firmware that allows the access to many features previously accessible on a DevKit/TestKit (used by game developers and testers) to a consumer.

## What can I do with a jailbroken PS4?

After a successful jailbreak, you can unlock and try the following:

<ul>
	<li>Install and play your game backups/disc games without needing a disc/license/PSN account.</li>
	<li>Access media apps such as YouTube, Netflix without the need of a PSN account.</li>
	<li>Access various homebrew and other fan-made tweaks to your favorite games such as useful applications, fan translations, undubs, emulators, 60FPS patches, etc.</li>
	<li>Make and install custom UI tweaks such as custom dynamic or static themes, removing and hiding useless apps from the homescreen, changing system sounds, etc.</li>
	<li>Access and install a fully featured OS like Linux to completely turn your PS4 into a PC.</li>
</ul>

## What can't I do with a jailbroken PS4?

While the advantages are plenty, you will lose some functionality such as:

<ul>
	<li>Online play on <strong>most</strong> games. This is the biggest factor of jailbreaking that many can live without. I used the term most because you can play online on some games by using custom servers, but that is more a bonus than something you should expect.</li>
	<li>All PSN features such as messaging, online trophy syncing, various PS Plus features such as online save data upload and other features that are dependent on PSN such as Spotify.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Depending on the release date of the jailbreak, firmware and games, some newer games will not be available. As soon as new jailbreak will appear, those new games will also appear.</li>
</ul>

## Other useful terms to know

  * Kernel panic = a forced reboot or shutdown caused by the unsuccessful attempt to jailbreak.
  * Webkit exploit = the first part of a full jailbreak, a vulnerability in PS4's Internet Browser (currently every single jailbreak uses this method).
  * Kernel exploit = the second part of a full jailbreak, a vulnerability in PS4's kernel which is the essential center of the operating system (provides basic services for all other parts of the OS).
  * GoldHEN = HEN is a abbreviation of Homebrew Enabler, that allows unlocking the ability to install and play packages (games or apps). GoldHEN is the definitive version of HEN which also adds more features (VR enabler, Remote Package Insalls, Rest Mode support, external HDD supoort, Debug Trophies and many <a href="https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN#features"> more </a>.
  * Homebrew = the term in PS4's scene, is any piece of application, modification of system that hasn't been directly done by Sony (ex: PS4Xplorer is a fan made file manager in form of a application)
  * Package (pkg) = the main format PS4 recognizes to pack games, updates, DLC, themes and more (similar to a archive).
  * Payload (in a .bin or .js format) = a file that allows modifying and adding unsigned code to run on the PS4.
  * FTP Transfers = FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, it is used to remotely send and receive files from and to the PS4 to a PC without the need of USB drives.
  * CFW = Custom FirmWare, a full fan-made firmware, designed for various jailbroken uses. **Note!: PS4 does not have any CFW**.
  * FAKE Packages (fake pkg or FPKG) = Homebrew packages that have not been created or verified by Sony. They are different from retail because they do not need a license or disc to be inserted, but requires the PS4 to jailbroken before attempting to launch them. While the name contains *fake*, they are not malicious, rather a term used to differentiate them from retail packages.
  * RETAIL Packages (retail pkg) = Packages created and verified by Sony that usually come directly from PS Store. These packages cannot be launched if the user does not have a license for the content they wish to launch. Themes however are the only retail packages that can be unlocked.
