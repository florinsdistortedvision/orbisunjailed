## What does "unlock a Retail Theme" mean?

* Retail themes are direct pkg signed and verified by Sony that come from PS Store.
* Unlocking a retail theme means creating a dummy fake pkg that will allow permanent application of a theme.
* This means, that you can install the theme, apply it and will stay applied after reboot / in unjailbroken mode. **Note that it only stays applied, you cannot change to another unlocked theme until you rejailbreak.**

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Download and extract :
   * <a href="https://github.com/Backporter/PS4-Retail-Theme-unlocker/releases/tag/1.1a"> PS4 Retail Theme Unlocker </a>
   * <a href="https://github.com/CyB1K/PS4-Fake-PKG-Tools-3.87/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"> PS4 FPKG Tools </a>
* Put all of PS4 FPKG Tools contents in the PS4 Retail Theme Unlocker's data folder.
* Drag and drop your **retail** pkg theme to PS4-Retail-Theme-unlocker.exe.
* It should now create a very small pkg file.
* Put both of the files on a root of USB Drive.
* Navigate on your PS4 to Settings > GoldHEN > Package Installer. **Select the small pkg created by the tool first**, then the main retail pkg.
* Select yes when prompted to override.
* Done.
